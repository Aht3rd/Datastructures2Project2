This project includes a makefile. The program is compiled using the 'make' command. 
The program is then run using the command '/main'. After compiling and running the program it will
prompt the user for the number ov events to simulate, the average arivals in a time period, the 
average number served in a time period, and the number of service channels. The number of service
must be between 1 and 10, if a value not between 1 and 10 is entered it will continue prompting the
user to enter until a value between 1 and 10 is entered. After the program is done getting the input
from the user it will run and print out the results of the simulation analysis as well as the analytical
results to the screen.
